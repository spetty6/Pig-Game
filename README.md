Problem:
The game of Pig is a simple two player dice game in which the first player to reach 100
or more points wins. Players take turns. On each turn a player rolls a six-sided die. After
each roll:
 If the player rolls 2 – 6, then they can either
o ROLL AGAIN or
o HOLD. At this point the sum of all rolls made this turn is added to the
player’s total score and it becomes the other player’s turn.
 If the player rolls a 1, then the player losses his turn. He gets no new points and it
becomes the opponent’s turn.
If the player reaches 100 or more points after holding then the player wins.
Write a program that plays the game of Pig, where one player is a human and the other is
the program. Allow the human to input ‘r’ or ‘R’ to roll again or ‘h’ or ‘H’ to hold.
Validate the input.
The computer program should play according to the following rule: Keep rolling on the
computer’s turn until it has accumulated 20 or more points, then hold. Of course, if the
computer wins or rolls a 1 then the turn ends immediately. Allow the human to roll first.
Write your program using at least two functions.
Above each function definition, create a flowerbox of documentation that has:
1) The name of the function
2) A Short description of the purpose of the function
3) A ‘dictionary’ of all incoming parameters
4) A description of the return value
